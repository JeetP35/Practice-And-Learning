The Training Grounds
This lesson has nothing to do with Python: I just want to show you a resource you have at your disposal for practicing your skills.

The Training Grounds ("Training" in the top nav) is where you can practice infinite coding challenges and interview questions. Our courses don't repeat themselves very often... our expectation is that once you learn a concept and complete its lesson, you're ready to move to the next concept.

If you find yourself wanting more practice before moving on, you can head over to the Training Grounds at any time and grind some challenges.

Challenges in the training grounds are personalized to you and what you've been working on recently, but you can also search the existing database of challenges to find specific topics.

If you're not a paying member you've been awarded 25 free challenges. Once you upgrade to a paid membership, you'll have unlimited challenges.
