Boots Interview
It's time for your first Boots interview lesson!

In these lessons, Boots turns on you! He becomes your interviewer rather than your tutor. Answer his open-ended question or follow his instructions. The chat will continue until he’s satisfied that your responses meet the acceptance criteria.

Treat it like a real interview:

You're allowed to ask clarifying questions without penalty (it's actually encouraged)!
You don't have to answer in one shot, have a back-and-forth conversation!
Boots will respond in one of three ways:

If you ask a question or give a partially correct or inconclusive answer, there's no penalty and Boots will ask a follow-up question or clarify the instructions
If you say something that's wrong or off-topic, you'll lose an armor/spree and Boots will try to redirect you
Once you satisfy the acceptance criteria, Boots will pass you
Assignment
Reference the following code snippet to answer Boots' question:

def calculate_damage(opening_attack, core_damage, finishing_move):
    total = opening_attack + core_damage + finishing_move
    return total


first_damage = calculate_damage(10, 20, 30)
second_damage = calculate_damage(5, 10, 15)
third_damage = calculate_damage(50, 60, 70)
print(first_damage)
print(second_damage)
print(third_damage)

Hide Solution

Boots is expecting you to satisfy the acceptance criteria:

The first call to `calculate_damage` stores the result in `first_damage`. The second call to `calculate_damage` stores the result in `second_damage`. The third call to `calculate_damage` stores the result in `third_damage`.
