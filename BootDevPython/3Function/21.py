Archmage
Congratulations on making it to the end of the functions chapter!

This is one of the hardest chapters in the Python course! Although dictionaries are no walk in the park either...

You've probably already figured out that:

Chests contain gems and items
Gems can buy items in the shop
Items help you earn achievements and XP
XP levels you up, and higher levels unlock new roles
So why should you care about your role?

You've probably almost earned (or maybe you already have) the Apprentice role. You can see your role at the top right of your screen. If you don't have a role yet, don't worry, you'll get Apprentice at level 10.

When you hit level 100, you'll unlock the final role, Archmage. It's kind of a big deal. When you hit archmage:

You'll have learned a ton, built many real-world projects, and should be starting your job search
You'll have unlocked all the private role-based chat channels in our Discord
You'll get a physical archmage coin in the mail as a token of your hard work
